#GW2 Raid Helper Bot

Just a fun project to learn about discord bots in Python. Maybe it'll do something useful one day.

## Setup

Create a file called .env. It should have the following contents:

    export DISCORD_TOKEN="<ENTER YOUR DISCORD TOKEN HERE>"

## Running

`make run`. This will perform any setup required.
